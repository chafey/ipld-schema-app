# ipld-schema-app

This is a simple web app that lets you edit IPLD schema and validate it for correctness.  It is based
on the [js-ipld-schema](https://github.com/ipld/js-ipld-schema) project and also borrowed the prism highlighting
configuration from the [ipdl specs vuexpress configruation](https://github.com/ipld/specs/blob/master/.vuepress/highlight.js)
